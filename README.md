# Password-storage-using-image-steganography

Storing passwords has always been one of the most difficult of jobs. This is a solution where you store passwords in an image using Image steganography.
image steganography uses the bits of the image pixels to store information. We use Least Singnificant Bits to store the information so that the overall image is not affected i.e one that cannot be noticed by our naked eye. To make it more safe we use Advanced encryption standard to encrypt the password stored in the image. We use a key to store all the passwords in an image. ONE KEY TO STORE THEM ALL!
